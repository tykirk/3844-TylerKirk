										<h2>Reflection </h2>
									</header>
									<p><p> After spending some time examining how digital media characterizes digital composition across today’s media, I have found that to my surprise, digital writing has played a huge role in the development and expansion of some of the most influential forms of information and entertainment. The more I research, and the closer I examine certain types of digital or non-digital information, I find that I am able to draw parallels between older forms of media to far newer ideas. I thought many concepts to be original, but have now learned that in many circumstances, material perceived as “original” is probably just the product of monumentally influential products from the past.  </p>

									<p>Unsurprisingly, there are many opposed to continue this trend, and it seems as if many are ready to apply more legality to the matter. I could see how at some point I may have deemed this appropriate, but now I lean more in the direction of an open source world. So much of the creative environment has already been defined by the wonders of open source material, and I believe that this allows for a steady flow of creative behavior. It has reached the degree where even certain companies seem similar (Uber and Lyft, for instance), yet they seem to occupy a symbiotic business environment, where neither is especially ailed by the other. Perhaps even to the extent of business and economics, similarity in company and market objectives are an advantage for all members involved. </p>

									<p>HTML as a coding language and discipline seems largely defined by the ability to remember quirky combination of figures and terms. Though I have definitely enjoyed the education so far, I still think it’s difficult to complete a round of HTML code without having to utilize additional resources, or reach out for the occasional helping hand. I hope to eventually achieve a point of mastery where I am able to both accurately employ HTML, and also remember all of its components as I do so. Admittedly, I held some inaccurate preconceived notion about HTML before I began learning about it in class. I did not know that it could be integrated with CSS tools, as was completely under the impression that HTML was only used for the foundation of websites. I now know that the opposite is true. HTML is surprisingly powerful, and when used in conjunction with other mechanisms, it is able to construct very complicated products. </p>

									<p>Before this class, I had little understanding of what digital writing was. It was my impression that digital writing was simply the craft of creating blogs, social media posts, essays, etc. I see that digital writing includes these things, but also many others, if not most other written components of the internet. Our focus occurred more on writing within the realm of HTML, and my view has shaped into a more technical understanding. Digital writing seems to not only be the actual writing audiences experience online, but also the underlying processes that allow the written material to exist. </p></p>
